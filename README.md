# ( WATTS ) Song Learning and Practice App

This is a Python-based application designed to assist users in learning new songs and practicing old ones using a spaced repetition algorithm. The app utilizes various tools and technologies, including pandas for data manipulation, rofi/dmenu for the graphical user interface, youtube-dl for downloading YouTube videos, and bash for scripting.

## Features

- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm**: The app incorporates a spaced repetition algorithm to help users efficiently memorize and review songs. The algorithm suggests songs for practice based on the user's previous performance and scores.
- **Database Storage**: The app allows users to store their songs in a database, providing an organized way to manage their repertoire. The songs can be easily accessed and played through the app.
- **YouTube Integration**: Users can pull song videos from YouTube directly through the app. The videos are ad-free, and they can be streamed or locally cached for offline usage.
- **Scoring System**: The app includes a scoring system that allows users to rate their performance and how well they remember each song. This information is utilized by the spaced repetition algorithm to suggest appropriate songs for practice.
- **Bluetooth Amp Connectivity**: The app offers an additional feature to connect your computer to an amplifier via Bluetooth. This enables users to enhance their practice sessions and enjoy playing along with their favorite songs.
